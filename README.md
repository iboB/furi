# furi

A header-only URI decomposition library for C99 and C++17

## Usage

* For C include `furi/furi.h`
* For C++ include `furi/furi.hpp`

The C++ code can be made compatible for C++11 if one removes all `std::string_view` instances. They can even be guarded with a macro. This can be done if there's interest.
